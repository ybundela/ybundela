Some Basic Lambda important notes.

When we have single void type method and have single line of code then, while writing Lambda exp 
we do not need to define return type.
In Lambda, we will add return keyword when we have more than one line of logic or have conditional statement.

While assigning the type for Lambda exp, We use functional interface. It can be predefined functional interface, or we can create our
own functional interface with default method.
